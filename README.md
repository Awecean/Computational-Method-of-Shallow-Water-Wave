# Computational Methods for Shallow Water Waves
This is where I store my programs for the course "Computational Methods for Shallow Water Waves" at NTU(Naional Taiwan University), Dept. of Engineering Science and Ocean Engineering.

## Self-Introduction
I am Po-Tao Lin, a junior student in the Dept. of Civil Engineering at NTU

## Why I use Github
Starting from Assignment 3, the programs require multiple files for function definitions and calls. Since it is not convenient to present them all in a single LaTeX file's appendix, I chose to use GitHub for better management and sharing.
